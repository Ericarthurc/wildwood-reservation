# Wildwood Reservation

Overview:
This project started as a rewrite of an older PHP project developed in the mid 2000s. The code was impossible for me to reverse engineer because I don’t know PHP and I don’t plan on learning it. The rewrite only takes the original concept of the PHP code and builds upon that; no original code was used.

The original code used a PHP and SQL stack. The project was created to make an easy way for people to reserve ‘seats’ for our Easter/Christmas services and have an email feedback. The original project was never a good solution though; it contained many issues and created more chaos than good.

Issues with original code:
- Unmanageable code
- Built on very old PHP code
- Unfriendly design (no css was used on the original project)
- Difficult to deploy to a server
- Required many database rewrites

New code goals:
The purpose of the rewrite is to bring the code to 2019 standards. I want a project that I understand and that I could teach to someone else in the future. A web app that is easily deployable and uses modern friendly tools.

New code tools:
- MERN Stack
- Mongoose schema
- Express backend
- React frontend
- Nodejs bringing it all together
- SMTP integration
- Bootstrap 4 standards (some custom css)
